 Exception: These are unwanted events that occurs during the runtime phase of the program and
 due to which the application/program terminated abnormally.  
 
 By handling exception in the program/application we can preserve the normal flow of the application.

 Throw : It helps the developer/programmer to throw an exception from any block explicitly.

 {
  throw new ArithmeticException();
 }

 method.
