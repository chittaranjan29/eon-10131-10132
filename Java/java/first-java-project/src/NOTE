Java:
It is class based, object oriented programming language which is platform independent.

Procedure Oriented Programming: C, Basic, Fortrain etc. 
 i)Platform dependency 
 ii)lack security 
 iii)Complexity
 
Object Oriented Programming: Java (1995)  - Green Team - James Gosling - oak, silk etc. - Sun Microsystem
Oracle Corporation
 
 Features:
  i)Platform independent(WORA - Write Once Run Anywhere).
  ii)Highly Secured.
  iii)Distributed.
  iv)Portable.
  v)Multithreading.
  vi)High Performance.
  vii)Robust(Grabage Collection, Exception Handling and memory Allocation)
  
  Compile and interpreted
  
  JDK=JRE + Runtime Libraries + Dev tools(javac, java, javadoc)
  
  Application:
  i)Standalone application.(CUI app or GUI app)
  ii)Desktop/GUI application.
  iii)Simple Web application.(MVC)
  iv)Enterprise Application.(REST API, Microservices etc)
  
  
  Editions:
  
  i)Java SE - Standard Edition
  ii)Java EE - Enterprise Edition(jsp, Servlet, JSTL, Java Beans etc)
  iii)Java ME - Micro Edition
  iv)Java FX - Rich internet app.
  
  
  Compile - javac Test.java    -> Test.class(Byte code)
  Run - java Test
  
  Test.java -> compile -> Test.class ->execute
  
  JDK - Java Development Kit
  JVM - Java Virtual Machine(Platform independent)
  JRE - Java Runtime Environment(Runtime Library)
  
  Jar files - packages, sub packages, compiled classes.
  Development tools : javac, java, javap, javaw, javadoc, applet etc.
  
  
  net.java - jar
  date.java
  
  Variables: Variables are just like containers used to store values into
  memory location.
 
  data Types:
  int a;
  float b;
  double g;
  long b;
  short d;
  String st;
  char ch;
  boolean b;
  
  
  Java identifiers:
  In programming languages, identifiers are used for identification purposes.
  In Java, an identifier can be a class name, method name, variable name or label.
  
  class Test
  {
  	public static void main(String args[])
  	{
  		int a =20;
  	}
  } 
  
  identifiers: Test, main, args, a, String 
  
  Identifier naming conventions:
  i)The only allowed characters for identifiers are all alphanumeric characters([A-Z],[a-z],[0-9]), $(dollar sign),
  and '_'(underscore).
  ii)Identifiers should not start with digits. 
  iii)Java identifiers are case sensitive.
  iv)Reserved keywords can not be used as an identifier. 
  
  Valid identifier names: MyVariable, MYVARIABLE, myvariable, x, i, x1, _myvariable, $myvariable
  sum_of_array, a123
  
  Invalid identifier names: My Variable, 123variable, a+b, variable-2, sum_&_difference
  
  
  
  Reserved Keywords: 53 reserved keywords.
  Any programming language reserves some words to represent functionalities defined by the language.
  These words are called reserved keywords.
  
  example: package, class, switch, break, for, while etc.
  
  Operators:
  Operators are the symbols used for performing specific operation in Java. 
  
  examle: int a=10;  // = assignment operator
          int result=a+b;// + addition  
          
          // result, a , b - operands
          // +,=   - operators
          
 based on operation type:
 i)Arithmetic Operators(+, -, *, /)
 ii)Assignment operators(=, +=, -=,*=, /=)
 iii)Relational operators(>,<,>=,<=, ==,!=)
 iv)Logical operators(&&, ||, !)    a>b && a>0, A!=0
 v)Bitwise operators(&, |,^,~)
 vi)Shift Operator(>>,>>>,<<)
 
 
 based on Number of operands works with:
 i)Unary operators(single operand) : ex: a++, --a, --b,b--, ++b(post/pre increment, post/pre decrement )
 ii)Binary operators(two operands) : a+b, a*b, a/b
 iii)Ternary operator/Conditional: (three operands)  
 
 int a=10,b=20;
 int result=(a>b)?a:b;     
 
 (expression)?true value: false value;  
 
 
 Decision making in Java:
 
 Decision making Java is similar to decision making in real life.
 In programming also we face some situations where we want to execute a block of code 
 when some condition is fulfilled. Decision making statements are also called
 control flow statements.
 
 i)if 
 ii)if-else 
 iii)Nested if else 
 iv)if-elseif-else 
 v)switch - menu driven program
 vi)jump statements(break, continue)
 
 Q:> WAP in Java to find out the minimum number among three numbers.
 
 Loops:A block of code gets executed repeatedly until and unless a condition is satisfied.
 
 a)Entry controlled: for, foreach, while
 b)Exit controlled: do-while
 
 i)for
   for(initialization;expression;value updation)
   {
   	body of the loop;
   }
 
 ii)foreach (Java 8)
 
 list.foreach(x -> sysout(x))
 
 iii)while
 
   while(expression)
   {
     body;
   }
 
 
 iv)do-while
 
 do
 {
 
   body;
 }
 while(expression);
 
 Series:
 WAP in Java to print the terms of the below series using loop.
 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, .... 100
