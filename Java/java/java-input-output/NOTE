Java I/O:

Java Input and Output is used to process the input and produce the output.

Java uses the concept of a stream to make I/O operation fast.

Stream is a sequence of data. In Java, stream is composed of bytes. 
It's called stream because it's like a stream of water that continues to flow.

In Java, three streams are created automatically. All these streams are attached with the console .

i)Input Stream (System.in)
ii)Output Stream(System.out)
iii)Error Stream(System.err)

Java brings various streams with its I/O package that helps the user to perform all the I/O operations.
There are two ways by which we can take the input from the user or other source

i)  BufferedReader Class(v 1.0 v)
It is a simple class that is used to read a sequence of characters. 
It has a simple function that reads a character another read which reads, 
an array of characters, and a readLine() function which reads a line.

InputStreamReader() is a function that converts the input stream of bytes into a 
stream of characters so that it can be read as BufferedReader expects a stream of 
characters.

    pasreInt(), parseFloat(), parseDouble(), parseLong() etc 
    
ii) Scanner Class:(1.6 v)
In Java, Scanner is a class present in java.util package for obtaining primitive
data types like int, float, double etc. using the Scanner class in Java is the easiest 
way to read the data in java program.
